I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) and part of the [Pietrzak Group
](https://ist.ac.at/de/forschung/pietrzak-gruppe/).

My current main research interests are:
- Scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus
- Efficient and Resilient Tree Communication Networks
- Parallel Smart Contract Execution
- Blockchain Scaling Solutions
- Human-centric Blockchain Design

I am also an avid supporter and contributor to open-source software.
I am a maintainer and co-founder of [Ldtteam](https://github.com/ldtteam) and contributed to numerous open-source projects with combined over 300 million downloads such as the Chia BLS library.
